# C Language Learning Journey

Welcome to my C language learning repository! üöÄ Here, I document my journey as I delve into the world of C programming.

## About the Author

Feel free to connect with me! Let's learn and grow together.

## To Make Most Of This Repo 
  - Make sure to fork this repo.
  - Then create a directory where you are thinking to put your code in.
  - `SHIFT + <RIGHT-CLICK>`, and open that folder in terminal.
  - Then come back to this github repo and click on the code button in green. Select the HTTPS option and copy the link.
  - Now return back to your command line terminal, and do the following --

        git clone https://github.com/mass-Eve/programming-with-C.git

  - And All Setüòä

## Repository Overview

- This repository is categorised on the basis of topics. Further, the topics are categorised from basics to intermediate, then advance.

- Each folder contains one (or more than) markdown file, which contains notes in the most simplified manner for that topic.

- Other than notes (in markdown files), there are also a lot of programs to practice.

## Code Structure

- The first folder is the *basic folder*.
    - It contains information about the basic building blocks of our beloved _C Language_.
- The Second folder is about Basic Arithmetic Problems.
    - It includes a notes file (in the markdown format), containing knowledge about Arithmetic Operators In C.
    - Then in another file, it contains information about the *Standard Mathematics Header File* In C.
    - Then, a lot of problems to practice.
    - The best part about the problems is that they are the problems that we have studied from class 1-12. As a result, we already know the formula and logic behind the problem, all we need to do is that convert that mathematical logic n terms of programming logic. That's it......
- The Third folder is about Relational & Logical Thinking. 
    - It includes a notes file containing the information about Relational and Logical Operators offered In C.
    - Then it gives information about the structures that we can use to implement those relational and logical operators in order to see them in **quick-real-action**. These structures include ~
        01. if-else ladder.
        02. switch(case) statements.
    - Then, a lot of problems to solve.
    - This folder specifically contain a lot of problems inspired from our daily life problems. So you are definitely going to enjoy them.
    - This folder is a must for activating your logical mind.
- The Fourth folder is about Looping.
    - Looping is a very essential concept in any programming language.
    - The first file in this folder will let you start your journey with loops very very easily by giving you the easy to understand syntax.
    - After this, you will be exposed to an exhaustive list of questions to practice in all the three loops.
    - The list is very exhaustive and is curated by my hands.
    - There will be time when you will see multiple implementations of the solution to the same problem.
- The Fifth folder will introduce you to problems regarding numbers.
    - There are different kinds of numbers in mathematics, and all of them have some different kinds of properties. You'll make programs regarding those properties.
    - Apart from this, you will also do some manipulation on numbers.
    - Trust me, it will be really fun.
- The Sixth folder is about Arrays.
    - This is where things will start getting crazy, as well as tough. 
    - It is possible that for a moment, you might start thinking that you have not learned anything yet! But it happens. 
    - And you need not to worry at all. Because I have also faced those problems and I have made it sure that anyone learning from my repository should not face the same.
- In Seventh folder, we'll move to *Strings*, which is basically another type of Arrays. 
    - For this section, please be 100% focussed while learning!
    - This topic is actually tough to understand because many things will be completely new to you.
    - But make sure not to worry.
- In Eight folder, we'll move to pointers.
    - Pointers is a real challenge for our understanding. Because it really challenges our beliefs that we have set till now.
    - Be 100% focussed here as well.
- In Ninth folder, you will encounter Functions.
    - Crazy topic.
    - It will implement everything that you have learned till now.
    - Along with some crazy new concepts.
- Tenth folder is about Recursion
    - *Recursion*, which is basically another type of function, is another real big challenge for our understanding.
- Eleventh Folder is about Unions and Structures.
- Twelth Folder is about File Handling With C Language.
    - It includes how you can manipulate text files using C Language.

Here are some helpful articles that are written by me only, which might help you when you will get some Strange kind of thought about some concepts in C
